# ft_lex üéπ

> *"Everything is controlled by electrical contacts and relays; I won't give you the details, you know all that. And besides, what's more, the piano really works."* - Boris Vian, L'√âcume des jours

Welcome to **ft_lex**, your friendly neighborhood lexer generator written in Zig! Just like Colin's pianocktail, this project converts musical notes (regex patterns) into delicious cocktails (token streams). üçπ

## üéØ What is ft_lex?

ft_lex is a POSIX-compliant lexer generator that takes `.l` files and transforms them into blazing-fast lexical analyzers. Think of it as the love child of `flex` and modern systems programming - it's fast, memory-safe, and doesn't make you want to pull your hair out.

### Current Status: Phase 1 Complete! üéâ

We're currently at **100/100** for the mandatory part. The core functionality is working beautifully:

- ‚úÖ **Parser**: Reads and parses `.l` files like a boss
- ‚úÖ **NFA Construction**: Thompson's algorithm implementation
- ‚úÖ **DFA Conversion**: Subset construction with state minimization
- ‚úÖ **Code Generation**: Spits out clean `lex.yy.c` files
- ‚úÖ **libl Library**: POSIX-compliant utility functions
- ‚úÖ **Testing Suite**: Comprehensive test coverage

### Next Steps for 125/100:
- üöß **Polyglotism**: Add `--target=zig` flag for Zig output (15 points)
- üöß **Compression**: Add `-Cf` flag for DFA compression (10 points)

```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Zig 0.11+ (because we're not living in the stone age)
- A terminal and some caffeine ‚òï

### Building the Beast
```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ft_lex

# Build it (Zig will handle everything)
make all

# Or if you're feeling fancy
zig build -Drelease-safe
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run the full test suite
make test

# Or manually
./tests/run_tests.sh
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Generate a lexer from your .l file
./ft_lex calculator.l

# Compile the generated lexer
cc lex.yy.c -o calculator -ll

# Run it with some input
echo "42+1337" | ./calculator
```

## üìù Example .l File

Here's a simple arithmetic lexer to get you started:

```lex
%{
#include <stdio.h>
%}

%%
[0-9]+      { printf("NUMBER(%s)\n", yytext); }
"+"         { printf("PLUS\n"); }
"-"         { printf("MINUS\n"); }
"*"         { printf("MULTIPLY\n"); }
"/"         { printf("DIVIDE\n"); }
[ \t\n]     { /* ignore whitespace */ }
.           { printf("ERROR: Unexpected character %s\n", yytext); }
%%

int main() {
    yylex();
    return 0;
}

int yywrap() {
    return 1;
}
```

## üß† The Magic Behind the Scenes

### 1. **Parser Phase**
Our parser reads your `.l` file and identifies three sections:
- **Definitions**: C code between `%{` and `%}`
- **Rules**: The regex-action pairs between `%%`
- **User Code**: Everything after the second `%%`

### 2. **NFA Construction**
Using Thompson's algorithm, we convert each regex pattern into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton. It's like building a musical score where each note can lead to multiple possible next notes.

### 3. **DFA Conversion**
The subset construction algorithm transforms our NFA into a Deterministic Finite Automaton. Now each note has exactly one next note - no more ambiguity!

### 4. **State Minimization**
We minimize the DFA to remove redundant states. It's like removing unnecessary musical rests from your composition.

### 5. **Code Generation**
Finally, we generate clean, optimized C code that implements your lexer as a state machine.

## üß™ Testing Your Lexer

We've included several test cases in the `tests/` directory:

- **arithmetic.l**: Basic arithmetic operations
- **parentheses.l**: Nested parentheses handling
- **edge_cases.l**: Boundary conditions and error handling

Each test compares our output against `flex` to ensure POSIX compliance.

## üé≠ The 42 Network Perspective

Hey fellow 42er! üëã 

This project is a perfect example of why we learn low-level programming. You're not just writing a lexer - you're implementing fundamental computer science concepts that power every compiler, interpreter, and parser out there.

**What you'll learn:**
- Finite automata theory (and why it matters)
- Compiler construction techniques
- Memory management in systems programming
- The beauty of state machines
- Why regex engines are secretly magic

**Pro tips for 42:**
- Read the POSIX spec carefully (it's actually helpful!)
- Test edge cases religiously
- Don't be afraid to draw state diagrams
- Remember: every bug is a learning opportunity üêõ

*"There's only one problem," said Colin. "The loud pedal for the whipped egg. I had to put in a special system of interlocking parts because when you play a tune that's too 'hot,' pieces of omelet fall into the cocktail and it's hard to swallow."*

Don't let your regex patterns be too hot, or you'll end up with omelet in your token stream! üç≥
